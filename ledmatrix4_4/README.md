# led matrix 4*4
LED matrixes are addressable LEDs which we can easily use them. You can have different colors by changing the RGB values. In this example you should just write the name of colors and values will be set.   
## requirement
### hardware
- arduino
- LED matrix
- jumper wires
### software
- Arduino IDE
### lirary
- FastLED from [github link](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)

## set up

We assume that you have Arduino IDE!

1. connet GND,Vcc and out of LED matrix to GND, 5V and pin3 of Arduino 
2. Download the library and add it to libraries(if you don't know,follow the manual installation section of this link  -> [add a library to Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries)
3. open this example and set the number of LEDs that you use.
4. compile,run and enjoy it! 

You see LEDs bllinking with period of 500ms.
