# HX711 set up
HX711 is a module which is specially designed for measuring weight. It has two channels,A and B. You can have either 64 or 128 times amplified signal on channel A and 32 on channel B.For measuring weight you have to connect a load cell to HX711. Load cell is a shaped metal that have strain gauge glue to it. When you bent it, its resistance changes.
## requirement

### hardware
- HX711 module
- 5kg load cell
- Arduino
- flat mounting surface 

### software
- Arduino IDE

### library
- The most complete library that I found is [github link] (https://github.com/sparkfun/HX711-Load-Cell-Amplifier)

## set up
1. For your scale to be ready follow step 1-3 of this [link] (https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Scale-With-5kg-Load-Cell-and-HX711-Amplifi)
2. Calibrate it with following readme of calibrate
3. Measuring weight with another code
4. Enjoy it!
