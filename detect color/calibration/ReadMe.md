# calibration
As you calibration is important and for this module we have to calibrate otherwise you don't have some importane datas.

# how should we do this?
I explained about wiring and another information that might be needed. In this section i just explain about calibration code.
In this code and in each loop a specific filter sets then the duration of reflecting signal measured.
So first fix the module. then put a white paper and write down the smallet value of each color. After that put a black paper and this time write the biggest value.
we are done with this part.
